        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>The goal of this graduate topics course is to take students from the rudiments all the way
        to some parts of the research frontiers of expansion, coding theory, and optimization both
        from a classical and quantum perspective.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Main Topics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Expander graphs combine two opposing properties of being well-connected yet
            sparse. This powerful combination leads to a variety of applications in CS (and mathematics)
              such as error correction, hardness of approximation, fast algorithms, sampling, etc. Recently, several notions
	      of high-dimensional expansion appeared, leading to exciting discoveries. </li>
            <li><strong>Coding theory:</strong> Codes are "robust" collections of strings that not only have implications
            for protection against errors in communication and storage, but they also have connections
            to diverse fields such as complexity theory, expansion, etc. Recently, many breakthrough
            constructions of codes were discovered, such as explicit binary codes close to the GV bound,
            good LTCs, and good qLDPC.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Convex programming, in particular, linear programming (LP) and semi-definite programming (SDP),
            are at the heart of many efficient algorithms. The use of powerful SDP hierarchies such as the Sum-of-Squares
            hierarchy has recently found many algorithmic applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>This is an advanced graduate topics course, so the primary goal is to develop your research maturity and increase your knowledge and skills. Grades will be a secondary concern. We do expect you to seriously attack your chosen research project, but there is no requirement of a tangible outcome.</p>
        <h3>Policy</h3>
 <ul>
 <li> Project: 80% <ul>
     <li> This will consist in selecting a research problem or paper related to the course in consultation with the instructor.
Students can either work in pairs or individually. The outcome should be a short research paper on the chosen topic (this
can range from a survey to an original result ;), and a presentation towards the end of the course.
In summary, a project will consist of the following:
<ul>
 <li> Selection of the research topic: consult the instructor to find a problem or paper aligned with your interests
   and the scope of the course. This can occur at any point (ideally, as we transition from phase 1 to 2).
 </li>
 <li> Mid-project feedback: collect the instructor's feedback on the progress of the project at approximately
   1 month before the end of the course.
 </li>
 <li> Research paper + presentation towards the end of the course.</li>
</ul>
     </li>
   </ul>
 </li> 
 <li> Participation: 20% </li>
     This includes attendance, curiosity, asking questions during class or office hours, etc.
