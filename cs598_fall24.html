        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>The goal of this graduate topics course is to take students from the rudiments all the way
        to some parts of the research frontiers of expansion, coding theory, and optimization both
        from a classical and quantum perspective.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Main Topics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Expander graphs combine two opposing properties of being well-connected yet
            sparse. This powerful combination leads to a variety of applications in CS (and mathematics)
            such as error correction, hardness of approximation, fast algorithms, sampling, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Coding theory:</strong> Codes are "robust" collections of strings that not only have implications
            for protection against errors in communication and storage, but they also have connections
            to diverse fields such as complexity theory, expansion, etc. Recently, many breakthrough
            constructions of codes were discovered, such as explicit binary codes close to the GV bound,
            good LTCs, and good qLDPC.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Convex programming, in particular, linear programming (LP) and semi-definite programming (SDP),
            are at the heart of many efficient algorithms. The use of powerful SDP hierarchies such as the Sum-of-Squares
            hierarchy has recently found many algorithmic applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>This is an advanced graduate topics course, so the primary goal is to develop your research maturity and increase your knowledge and skills. Grades will be a secondary concern. We do expect you to seriously attack your chosen research project, but there is no requirement of a tangible outcome.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
        <p>Mathematical maturity is the only pre-requisite. Having taken some proof-based courses in CS or math may be extremely helpful.</p>
